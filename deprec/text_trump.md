## Free from bureaucracy:

To transcend the rigid and innovation-reducing nature of large established structures like classical academia or big tech companies, the sprouting of small, puristic independent research initiatives is currently omnipresent.
This can be thus seen as a natural evolutionary process and similar developments are can be observed in the independent art scene or tech startups.
While not all bureaucratic aspects can be completely removed, the institute will internally cultivate sleek and omnidirectionally transparent processes to reduce bureaucratic burden to an absolute minimum. 
The interfacing of research projects with external entities will be evaluated case by case and common strategies developed towards the common goal.
