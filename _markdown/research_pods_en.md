### Research Pods

Currently, three Research Pods are offered with different time effort and budgets.
The Pods are designed to be able to iterate an idea through increasing levels of engagement, so that results of the Research Sprint could inform a follow up Research Residency which in turn could lead to a full-blown Research Project.
Topics can be either chosen from own ideas or our cultivated catalogue. In any case, topics and methods should be selected according to ethical standards and good practice in science. Empirical work is favoured. Research Pod applications will be evaluated by the current board of the institute. 
The institute is currently devised to be modular and constantly evolving - to naturally grow along the needs and opportunities of involved researchers and supporters. Structure and methods of the Research Pods are therefore subject to change. The ultimate goal is to establish a network and infrastructure which allows to host more and more Research Residencies and Projects. Internal budgets will currently cover up to 10 Research Sprints and 1-2 Research Residencies per year, given the annual budget of 25'000 CHF is covered by the crowdfunding efforts.

## Research Sprint

A sprint of a research idea, research design, prototype or experiment within a week of focused and structured work. The environment will be distraction-free with pre-set but customisable digital tools. The concept of the Research Sprint Pod is loosely based on Design Sprint principles (#source).
As an outcome researchers will primarily deliver a report with a clear conclusion and future directions. The report, code/prototypes, pilot data will be published under open science principles, Creative Commons licenses, and a DOI on the institute's website.

### Key points:

- 1 week, currently max. 10 Sprints per year
- Focus! 6 hours a day, distraction-free
- 1-3 persons
- Budget: 1000 CHF per person including board and lodging, internal budget
- Outcome: report (2 pages), code/prototype, pilot data

## Research Residency

From scratch or following a Research Sprint, more in-depth research can be performed within a Research Residency. Depending on pre-existing work or data availability, experiments can be performed, survey data gathered, data analyses performed, or grant proposals written (e.g. for Research Projects). The local environment (http://bahnstrasse44.ch/mieter/) will allow for a transdisciplinary, practical and creative exchange, which is encouraged. While the bureau will be reserved for the time of the Residency, researchers are not obliged to spend their time at the bureau. Research resources are currently limited to IT infrastructure for data gathering and analysis. Respective lab equipment or materials have either to be organized or used in external facilities.
Depending on the wide range of possible research projects in this Research Pod, funding has to be individually planned. Given the current state of the institute, low budget and infrastructure projects are preferred. Applications will be considered accordingly.
Besides a report documenting the Residency published on the institute's website (max. 5 pages), Research Residencies should output respective (open) data, articles (e.g., preprints), or code/prototypes in official platforms with the institute as (co-)affiliation. 
All output will be published under open science principles, Creative Common licensing, and linked on the website. 
Research grant proposals should be submitted by the end of the Residency.
Additionally, the Residency should be introduced and results disseminated in a public in-house podium (https://prozess.be/).

### Key points:

- 1-3 months, currently max. 2 Residencies a year
- 1-2 persons
- Budget: from institute and/or project funding, crowdfunding
- Outcome: Report. Research data, code/prototypes, articles, grant proposals, other formats. Presentation in-house

## Research Projects

Research Projects are externally-funded long-term research endeavours, for which the institute provides the affiliation, project management, data analysis and network opportunities. Project ideas can be derived from own work, the institute's catalogue, or ideally following up on Research Sprints or Residencies ideas, including grant proposals. 
Research Projects are key Research Pods which allow researchers to perform self-organised, independent and innovative research but also helping to establish the institute per se. Therefore, the current structure and future efforts are concentrated on establishing this Research Pod with a respective infrastructure, expertise, and network.
As Research Projects will basically be subject to dynamics of the respective research fields, output formats will be chosen accordingly. 
All data and manuscripts should be published under principles of open science, Creative Common licensing and the institute should be (co-)affiliated.
A report upon completion should document the project in details (max. 20 pages) and will be published on the institute's website.
Additionally, the project should be introduced and results disseminated in a public in-house podium (https://prozess.be/).


### Key points:

- Months to years, unlimited Projects
- 1-x persons
- Budget: external funding, crowdfunding
- Outcome: Report. Field-appropriate research data and manuscripts, code/prototypes, other formats. Presentation in-house
