# FF-Vision

We want to cultivate an open platform for independent research that supports transdisciplinary, person-oriented, and dynamic research on topics relevant to society. 
In the ongoing information age, research is re-defining itself with freely usable scientific tools, open data and community science.
These paradigm changes enable truly independent and relevant research besides classical academia or the private sector. 
Following principles of open and community science, research performed at the institute adheres to these principles and transparency in general.
In order to produce meaningful and reproducible research, all results or insights should be published.


## Beyond disciplines:

Research should not be limited to common scientific discipline schemata, but rather be able to freely evolve along current opportunities, technologies and needs.
Trans-, cross-, inter-, or multidisciplinary approaches can be explored and output formats are not fixed. We furthermore encourage researchers to consider different forms of research, communication, and dissemination besides publication in manuscripts or databases: Events, exhibitions, excursions, workshops, performances, AMAs, excursions, panel discussions etc. can therefore be used to reflect research in societal and artistic contexts.
These activities can be supported by the in-house and institutional network. 

## People before processes:

The institute is tailored to cater to the researcher's individual needs and intrinsic motivation. We put people before processes and offer protected environment to pursue independent research.
Furthermore, the established structures allow for exploration, proof of concepts, and ultimately also to rejection of a research idea or trajectory without repercussions for the individual. This allows for pragmatic, transparent and productive scientific progress and true personal identification with the research.

## Dynamics:

We favour dynamic workflows in which agile and pragmatic research can be performed. Respective techniques are adopted from creative workflows from the fields of design, computer science, and arts. Research ideas can be tested and evaluated in short time windows without structural and organisational interference. Supported by sleek digital infrastructures, a rapid cycle iterative science process will be cultivated. 


# Natural growth and the three pillars of the institute

The institute is conceptualised as an emerging and evolving community for independent research. To be able to grow healthy and adjust (infra)structures to needs and not vice versa, we, first, aim at establishing ...

## Infrastructure, network and expertise

a digital and physical infrastructure as well as a network of researchers, supporters and partners. Over time and as a consequence of the growing network and expertises ...

## Dissemination, Teaching and empowering

teaching of general and specific scientific methods, presentations of research, and empowerment for the non-scientific community is envisioned in a second phase. 
The aim here is to establish interactions between researchers, interested persons and the general public.

## Research projects

Finally, building on the other two pillars, in- and extensive research projects will become possible.
Currently, the institute is structured into three Research Pods, which allow for small-scale exploratory research projects.
