# FF-Vision

The institute will be a growing platform for independent research that supports transdisciplinary, person-oriented, dynamic and bureaucracy-free research on topics relevant to society. 
In the ongoing information age, research is currently re-defining itself with open data, libraries, and freely accessible scientific tools.
These paradigm changes enable truly independent and relevant research besides research in classical academia or in the private sector. 
Following principles of open and community science, research performed at the institute should adhere to these principles and transparency in general.
In order to produce meaningful and reproducible research, all results or insights should be published, even null-findings.


## Beyond disciplines:

Research should not be limited to common scientific discipline schemata but rather be able to freely evolve along current needs, opportunities and technologies.
Trans-, cross-, inter-, or multidisciplinary approaches can be explored and output formats are not fixed. We encourage to consider different forms of research cycles, communication, and dissemination besides classical publication in manuscripts or databases. Events, exhibitions, excursions, workshops, performances, AMAs, excursions, panel discussions etc. can therefore help to reflect research on broader societal and artistic levels.

## People before processes:

The institute is tailored to cater to the researcher's individual research needs and intrinsic motivation. We put people before processes and offer protected environment to pursue individual or community-driven goals.
Furthermore, the established structures allow for exploration, proof of concepts, and ultimately also to rejection of a research idea or trajectory without repercussions for the individual. This allows for pragmatic, transparent and productive scientific progress but also true personal identification with the topic and methods.

## Dynamics:

We favour dynamic workflows where agile and timely research can be performed. Respective techniques are adopted from creative workflows from the fields of design, computer science and arts. Research ideas can be tested and evaluated in short time windows without wasting too much time and other resources. Open and unbiased results and failure culture is embraced as well as a rapid cycle iterative science. 


## Free from bureaucracy:

To transcend the rigid and innovation-reducing nature of large established structures like classical academia or big tech companies, the sprouting of small, puristic independent research initiatives is currently omnipresent.
This can be thus seen as a natural evolutionary process and similar developments are can be observed in the independent art scene or tech startups.
While not all bureaucratic aspects can be completely removed, the institute will internally cultivate sleek and omnidirectionally transparent processes to reduce bureaucratic burden to an absolute minimum. 
The interfacing of research projects with external entities will be evaluated case by case and common strategies developed with towards the common goal.


# Natural growth and the three pillars of the institute

The institute is conceptualised as an emerging and evolving community for independent research. To be able to grow healthy and adjust (infra)structures to needs and not vice versa, we, first, aim at establishing ...

## Infrastructure, network and expertise

a digital and physical infrastructure as well as a network of researchers, supporters and partners. Over time and as a consequence of the growing network and expertises ...

## Teaching and empowering


teaching of general and specific scientific methods, presentations of research, and empowerment for the non-scientific community are envisioned in a second phase. 
The aim here is to establish a full circle of community-driven research with respective dialogue and exchange between the general public and research experts.

## Research projects

Finally, building on the other two pillars, in- and extensive research projects should become possible.
Currently this is structured into three Research Pods, which allow for small-scale and exploratory research projects.
